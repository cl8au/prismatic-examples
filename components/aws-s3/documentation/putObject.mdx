:::note
**File Contents** can be a reference to a binary file from a previous step.
For example, if you have an [HTTP Get](components/http.mdx#httpget) action that pulls down a .png image, you can reference its step name to write the .png to S3.
Or, **File Contents** can be simple text, like `'Hello World'`.
