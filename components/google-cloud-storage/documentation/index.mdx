## GCP Developer Documentation

Documentation for the Node.js client used in this component can be found at https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/storage/latest.

The Google Cloud Storage component requires a username / private key pair for authentication.
To create a GCP service account, follow directions on https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started.

After creating a service account, you will have an option to create a key for the account.
This will generate a .json file with `type`, `project_id`, and a dozen other fields.
The `client_email` field (something like `service-account-name@gcp-account-id.iam.gserviceaccount.com`) will serve as your credential `username`, and the `private_key` which starts with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` will serve as your credential `private_key`.
