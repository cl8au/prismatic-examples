:::note
**File Contents** can be a reference to a binary file (JavaScript `Buffer`) from a previous step.
For example, if you have an [HTTP Get](components/http.mdx#httpget) action that pulls down a .png image, you can reference its step name to write the .png to Google Cloud Storage.
Or, **File Contents** can be simple text, like `'Hello World'`.
