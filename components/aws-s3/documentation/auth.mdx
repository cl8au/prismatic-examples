An AWS IAM [access key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) is required to interact with AWS S3.
The AWS **access_key_id** serves as the **API Key**, and the **secret_access_key** serves as the **API Secret**.
Make sure that the key pair you generate in AWS has proper permissions to the S3 resources you want to access.
Read more about S3 IAM actions in the [AWS docs](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/AmazonS3/latest/userguide/using-with-s3-actions.html).
