## AWS Developer Documentation

An AWS IAM [access key pair](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html) is required to interact with AWS S3.

The `access_key_id` and `secret_access_key` can saved into Prismatic's [credential store](credentials.mdx) using the `API Key / Secret` authorization method as the `API Key` and `API Secret` respectively.
