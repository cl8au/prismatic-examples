## What is Prismatic?

Prismatic is an integration platform built specifically for B2B software companies. It’s an easier way to build, deploy, and support integrations for your customers.

Prismatic reduces integration effort and empowers everyone involved in the integration process with the tools they need for their roles, so you can spend less time on integrations and more time on core product innovation.

With Prismatic, you can:

- Build reusable [integrations](https://www.prismatic.io/docs/integrations) in an intuitive integration designer
- Deploy customer-specific integration [instances](https://www.prismatic.io/docs/instances) with unique [configurations](https://www.prismatic.io/docs/configuration-variables) and [credentials](https://www.prismatic.io/docs/credentials)
- Run your integrations in a purpose-built environment
- Provide better support with built-in [logging](https://www.prismatic.io/docs/logging) and [alerting](https://www.prismatic.io/docs/monitoring-and-alerting)
- Embed a white-labeled customer integration portal
- Mold the platform to your product, industry, and the way you build software

## Who uses Prismatic?

Prismatic is for B2B (business-to-business) software companies, meaning software companies that provide applications used by businesses. It's a good fit for products/teams at any stage, including early stage SaaS, established SaaS, and legacy or on-prem systems.

Many B2B software teams serve customers in niche vertical markets, and we designed Prismatic with that in mind. We provide powerful and flexible tools so you can build exactly the integrations your customers need, no matter who your customers are, no matter what systems you need to connect to, no matter how “non-standard” your integration scenario.

## What kind of integrations can you build using Prismatic?

Prismatic supports integrations ranging from simple and standard to complex, bespoke, and vertical-specific.
Teams use it to build integrations between applications of all kinds, SaaS or legacy, with or without a modern API, regardless of protocol or data format.
Here are some example use cases:

- Use job data from your system to create invoices in your customers’ ERP.
- Import and process data from third-party forms that vary significantly from customer to customer.
- Email activity summary reports with parameters and intervals defined on a per-customer basis.
