[AWS S3](https://aws.amazon.com/s3/) is a file storage solution from Amazon Web Services.
The AWS S3 component allows you to create, read, update, move, list or delete objects (files) within an AWS S3 bucket.

A common integration pattern involves listing files in a file store, and performing a series of actions on the array of files that are returned.
See our [looping over files](quickstarts/looping-over-files.mdx) quickstart for information about how to create a loop over an array of files.
