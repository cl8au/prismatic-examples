The Google Cloud Storage component requires a username / private key pair for authentication.
To create a GCP service account, follow directions on https://cloud.google.com/docs/authentication/getting-started.

After creating a service account, you will have an option to create a key for the account.
This will generate a .json file with **type**, **project_id**, and a dozen other fields.
The **client_email** field will serve as your credential **Username**, and the **private_key** which starts with `-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----` will serve as your credential **Private Key**.
