[Cloud Storage](https://cloud.google.com/storage) is Google's cloud file/blob storage system.
This component allows you to create, download, modify, list, and delete files stored in a Google Cloud Storage bucket.

Documentation for the Node.js client used in this component can be found at https://googleapis.dev/nodejs/storage/latest.

A common integration pattern involves listing files in a file store, and performing a series of actions on the array of files that are returned.
See our [looping over files](quickstarts/looping-over-files.mdx) quickstart for information about how to create a loop over an array of files.
